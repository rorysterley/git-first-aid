# Git First Aid

A repo for putting git commands into your own words. Do please contribute.


## Contributing

If you have mastery of a particular git command or find errors in my notes
please contribute.

The 'git-notes.txt' is intended as a quick reference guide. For clarity in the
long run it would be best to make new files like so: 'rebase-basics.txt' or
'typical-work-flow.txt'.
